## Motivation

This is a much-needed update for my personal website. It's less a portfolio and more a centralized reference for all my various internet-related activities.

## Installation

This website is built using [Enchilada](https://github.com/ericwbailey/enchilada), my dogfooded personal project boilerplate. To get a copy working on your own machine (for whatever reason), clone it via the command line: `https://github.com/ericwbailey/enchilada.git`

From there, you can follow [Enchilada's setup instructions](https://github.com/ericwbailey/enchilada/wiki/First-Time-Setup#scaffolding). Let me know if they don't work!

## Contributing

I'm not really looking for feature requests for this project, as it's my personal website. I would love, however, to get bug reports, especially about accessibility issues, browser rendering inconsistencies, performance bottlenecks, and general usability criticism.

The best way to submit these issues is using this repo's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/ericwbailey/ericbailey.design/issues). Please make sure you read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ericwbailey/ericbailey.design/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-issues) before doing so!

If you can't or won't use GitHub, my personal email is listed in [`AUTHORS`](https://github.com/ericwbailey/ericbailey.design/blob/master/AUTHORS). I can also be reached on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ericwbailey), as well as on the other social networking services linked to on my site.
