## Motivation

This is a much-needed update for my personal website. It's less a portfolio and more a centralized reference for all my various internet-related activities.

## Installation

This website is built using [enchilada](https://github.com/ericwbailey/enchilada), my dogfooded personal project boilerplate. To get a copy working on your own machine (for whatever reason), clone it via the command line: `https://github.com/ericwbailey/enchilada.git`

From there, you can follow [enchilada's setup instructions](https://github.com/ericwbailey/enchilada/wiki/First-Time-Setup#scaffolding). Let me know if you run into any issues!

## Contributing

As it is my personal website, I'm not really looking for feature requests for this project. I would, however, love to get bug reports, especially about accessibility issues, browser rendering inconsistencies, performance bottlenecks, and general usability criticism.

The best way to submit these issues is using this repo's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/ericwbailey/ericwbailey.design/issues). Please make sure you read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ericwbailey/ericwbailey.design/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-issues) before doing so!

If you can't or won't use GitHub, my personal email is listed in [`AUTHORS`](https://github.com/ericwbailey/ericwbailey.design/blob/master/AUTHORS). I can also be reached on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ericwbailey), as well as on the other social networking services linked to on my site.
